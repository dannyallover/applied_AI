# Artificial Intelligence Projects

A collection of AI projects that I worked on from UC Berkeley's AI course (cs 188) taught by Pieter Abbeel and Anca Dragan. Each project is an implementation of various algorithms that will be used by a pacman agent to complete its objective (and maximize expected utility).

Project 1 (Search): depth first search, breadth first search, uniform cost search, A* Search, heuristics. <br>
Project 2 (Games): reflext agent, minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax, evaluation functions. <br>
Project 3 (RL): value iteration, policies, asynchronous value iteration, prioritized sweeping value iteration, q-learning, epsilon greedy, approximate q-learning. <br>
Project 4 (Ghostbusters): <br>
Project 4 (ML): <br>
