# Artificial Intelligence Algorithms

A collection of AI projects that I worked on from UC Berkeley's AI course (cs 188) taught by Pieter Abbeel and Anca Dragan. Each project is an implementation of ai/ml algorithms that will be used by a pacman agent to complete its objective (and maximize expected utility).
